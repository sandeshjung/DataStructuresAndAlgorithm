# How to create a tuple

newTuple = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
print(newTuple)

#time complexity: O(1)
#Space complexity: O(n)

myTuple = (1,4,5,2,5)
myTuple1 = (1,2,6,9,8,7)
#concatenate the tuple
print(myTuple+ myTuple1)

# * operator

print(myTuple *4)

# in, count, len, min, max is similar to that of list 

print(myTuple.index(4))
